		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>My name is Stuart Simon. I was born in 1986 to two very special parents, both of them physicians. Both were immersed with the latest technology to help with their work at home, and thus I had plenty of opportunities to become fascinated with computers from an early age. This I did, and it continued throughout high school and college. During graduate school, I was immersed in a library science degree at a school that was very focused on the use of technology in the library. Currently I am working to receive a Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Applied Computing from Tulane University and expect to receive the degree in spring 2016. This site aims to be an online repository for my projects.</p>

		  As of September 2015, I am currently beginning my final year in a Certificate in Integrated Application Development. It is technically a university degree. Classes are held in the evenings only. Although it is generally not recommended to post examples of homework in a professional portfolio, I am posting this here because as of this writing it is only two weeks old and my only tangible experience with HTML5 and CSS that I have coded on my own, other than this homepage.

		  This project, a side project to my HTML course at Tulane, helped me fashion pre-existing Web page content into the template structure required by my course instructor. Through it, I gained experience in JavaScript, the HTML5 Document Object Model (DOM), and jQuery (a popular JavaScript library for querying and manipulating the DOM) before I learned any of those technologies in a classroom setting.

		  I have designed the entire photography Web site of Eric E. Simon. This I did in Adobe Dreamweaver using XHTML 1.0 Transitional. I am pleased with the output and plan to re-work the site in HTML5 and use more JavaScript than the Juicebox photo galleries presented here.
