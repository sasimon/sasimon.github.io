			<dd>As of September 2015, I am currently beginning my final year in a Certificate in Integrated Application Development. It is technically a university degree. Classes are held in the evenings only. Although it is generally not recommended to post examples of homework in a professional portfolio, I am posting this here because as of this writing it is only two weeks old and my only tangible experience with HTML5 and CSS that I have coded on my own, other than this homepage.</dd>

			<dd>I have designed the entire photography Web site of Eric E. Simon. This I did in Adobe Dreamweaver using XHTML 1.0 Transitional. I am pleased with the output and plan to re-work the site in HTML5 and use more JavaScript than the Juicebox photo galleries presented here.</dd>
