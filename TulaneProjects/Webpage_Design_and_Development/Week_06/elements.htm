   <p>I came to this class knowing CSS syntax, but have had somewhat less experience with it than HTML. But the first CSS tutorial has helped in that regard. It is a powerful tool, much more powerful than the &lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; tags could ever be. At any rate, the most difficult decisions for me were the colors to use, where to use them, and where to apply text effects.</p> 
   <p>I came to this project with an idea of using background colors for the header, the footer, the sections, the navs, and the asides, but I could not make up my mind which to use, only that I wanted to try something other than green. If there's one thing I remembered from my Human-Computer Interaction class, it is that I should not subject my viewers to primary color overload, although I seem to be immune to it. This is how I came upon the idea of using secondary colors in various combinations. I made the navs opaque to make them stand out. That left the section, aside, and footer. One I colored cyan, one of the others magenta, and the remaining one yellow.</p> 
   <p>I also knew early on that a lot of my text and pseudo-class manipulation would come in the form of changing the styles of hyperlinks in various states. This I admittedly came to by mentally following the model of Sunny Acres. I ended up fine-tuning the links in my links page just as much for the reason that a browser extension that I have since disabled was interfering with my choice of color for the links. I chose as close to orange as Web-safe colors would permit in order that it would contrast with both the background image and the transparent cyan it was immediately on.</p> 
   <p>As for the background image, I knew that it was already on the home page. I placed it in the background to prove that the background colors of the section, aside, and footer were transparent. I am fully aware that there is point value in the page being to your liking, but I did not see any other way. I liked to use the image for that purpose because it is monochromatic. Thank you for visiting!</p>
