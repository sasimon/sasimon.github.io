<h1>Final Elements, Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>How to approach the final exam, a collection of Design Topics based on all that I had learned, was a difficult decision. Although I was told I could recycle assignments, I thought it defeated the purpose of demonstrating what I had learned. I knew that there were other convenient methods to approach design topics in the text, so I decided to do additional work. What I ended up doing was the first six Review Exercises from Tutorials 1-6. That and the XHTML tutorials make up the seven requisite Design Topics. Of course all have their own stylesheets.</p>

<p>The Design Topics in the nav bar on this page are listed by their topic rather than their content, but the topics are in order of what I had learned. The Review Exercises tie in to the project created in each tutorial, but they are separate outcomes and newly-produced content.</p>

<p>To even have a close copy of what is in the text takes considerable thought and decision-making, especially when it comes to Tutorial 6, which took so much time I did not have time to do the review exercise for Tutorial 8; however, I had met my quota. The one noticeable thing I did differently to how I approached the last assignment in Tutorial 6 was to leave the inline validation in; I wanted to prove that I knew the syntax. It generates an error when used with W3C CSS validation, but it is part of the draft specifications for CSS 4 at <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors/#validity-pseudos">https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors/</a>. I also had to make decisions about using legends or labels for radio buttons (I ended up with the latter) and using the &quot;for&quot; keyword versus nesting inputs in labels (I could not achieve a good result with the latter, so I chose the former).</p>

<p>The others, including XHTML were relatively straightforward. Indeed, I had no trouble with fixing errors with XHTML. With the topics of the structure of HTML5, Web site development, introductory CSS, and tables I had little trouble. The one other thing I did have trouble comprehending was the parts where browser extensions were used in exercises, but it made me comfortable in using them to support the widest range of browsers. I tested on Firefox and Chrome, but I feel comfortable with specifying other browser extensions as well, particularly now that Opera is taking up Chromium and that more and more browsers are supporting CSS 3 natively.</p>

<p>A final note: This page serves as the hub for Week 12. I feel it is necessary to link my home page to here only (in terms of Week 12 links); however, the constituent assignments are linked to the home page directly from their end.</p>
