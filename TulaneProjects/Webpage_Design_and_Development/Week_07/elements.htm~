   <h1>Stuart Simon's Elements of Web Site Design, Week 7</h1> 
   <p>This week, I decided to follow the tutorial more or less as it was given to me. This is not a decision of negligence; it is merely my admission that the gray background served as a better background for Lincoln's speech than any other. It also highlights the Century Gothic font, which I thought was a good choice for the navigation lists, particularly with its single story "a".</p> 
   <p>A large part of the choice I had was with the links list. Since we were on a page with the text of Lincoln's Second Inaugural, I chose to remove that link from the list and replace it with a strong element, as many Web sites do to the "current" item in their nav lists. For this, I added a "nav ul li strong" style rule to the style sheet.</p> 
   <p>Speaking of style sheets, after doing the case assignment, it is my understanding that the reset concept refers not so much to a reset stylesheet as to a default style rule. Maybe it will be in a different stylesheet, or maybe it will not. In this assignment, the default style rule was in the main stylesheet, so no reset stylesheet was used. Another reason this is true is that the case Web page took substantially less time than the tutorial Web page, so it was not necessary to hide the unstarted sections.</p> 
   <p>The choice of links was relatively simple to make. The texts of the other 15 speeches were relatively easy to find on the Internet. I knew from the beginning that I wanted Everett's speech to be among the ones I added. In tenth grade I had heard that somebody had spoken for two hours ahead of Lincoln's fifteen-or-so minutes, but not until the past year or so did I know that the speech survives somewhere. At the same time I found out about Mario Savio. Those two speeches and Nixon's farewell speech were easy; it was only after I had been to the real American Rhetoric site that I decided to include Bush's 9/11 speech and Obama's 2008 victory speech as the final two. I included five additional links rather than four because I had removed the link from the item for Lincoln's Second Inaugural. </p>
