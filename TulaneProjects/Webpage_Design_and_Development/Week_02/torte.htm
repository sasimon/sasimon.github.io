   <!--Each customer review is within a paragraph itself nested in a blockquote. Bylines (Reviewed by...) are preceded by line break tags and em dashes. Names and dates are within cite and time elements, respectively.
   I reviewed the current standard for the <time></time> tags and determined that I could translate them into machine-readable dates and times by using the datetime attribute and a format "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss," or simply "yyyy-MM-dd." This is what I did here.-->

    <p> I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely. <br /> —Reviewed on <time datetime="2014-09-22">Sep. 22, 2014</time> by <cite>MMASON.</cite> </p>

   <blockquote> 
    <p> Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor. <br /> —Reviewed on <time datetime="2014-09-01">Sep. 1, 2014</time> by <cite>GLENDACHEF.</cite> </p>

   <blockquote> 
    <p> Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays. <br /> —Reviewed on <time datetime="2014-08-28">August 28, 2014</time> by <cite>BBABS.</cite> </p>
