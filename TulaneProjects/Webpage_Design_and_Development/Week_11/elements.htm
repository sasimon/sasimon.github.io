   <h1>Elements</h1> 
   <p>It was difficult designing this week's Web sites. I was fond for the most part of what the book put in front of me, though I am partly motivated by the challenge of doing something that doesn't look exactly like one out of the book. I know that some people took their original DessertWEB page from Tutorial 2 as a starting point, but I decided to use the new one and change it subtly.</p> 
   <p>The subtlest of the differences was even required by our assignment: to have at least one rotated page element. Really, the only thing suitable for that purpose is the image of the product itself, so I rotated it 5 degrees. I tried 30 degrees, but it was interfering with the text and looked unappetizing when knocked too much out of alignment. The other ways I changed the appearance was to opt for a red inset border in the main page element instead of the outset border the book's exercise required, and to use a rainbow gradient in the reviews. I figured it was wild, and I wanted to see if it was possible. Indeed it was.</p> 
   <p>Speaking of gradients, this is where I differed the most from the book's exercise. I wanted to make sure I created a unique experience as much as possible across browsers. So I ignored the injunction to use browser extensions to create <em>different</em> effects in browsers, but I did invoke them in my CSS, albeit to create the same effect. Due to the time lapse between the book's publication and now and the release of Internet Explorer 10 in the interim, I doubted that anybody would be able to view my Web site on anything that does not support something close to the CSS3 gradient rules. Therefore, using the Filter = Gradient(... syntax required by old versions of IE, whose syntax violates W3C's CSS syntax rules of not having an equal sign in parentheses, did not seem worth my trouble.</p> 
   <p>To deal with different media is fun, and I hope to do more with this in the final exam, and in my upcoming projects outside of class.</p>
