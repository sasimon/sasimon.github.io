   <p>Because I had to design an entire Web site, the most challenging thing about this week was knowing that I was dealing with a fictional entity. This came to the front in two places.</p> 
   <p>First, the links on the Calendar Web Page do not always link to the described entity. I knew that in order to make the grade, I needed to make some of the links on the pages whose links were already in the tutorial-warranted nav bar. I decided to cash in on that by converting the names in the introductory paragraph to the calendar to external links. I knew that the actual acts mentioned were fictional, yet I also knew that if designing a Web site for a real performing arts organization, the names of the performers would be linked in running text. So I stand by my decision to link the names.</p> 
   <p>Second, the location indicated on the Directions page is obviously not on Canyon Drive. I actually mapped out Chamberlain, and the closest thing to a Canyon Drive is a Canyon Road in a rural area. It is not a suitable location for a civic center. I very carefully used Google Maps to mask a location as the Chamberlain Civic Center. Because I used the Google Maps API on a custom map, users must take the extra step of right clicking the pin to get driving directions. I favor credibility over usability, and this was the least I could do to mask the fact that the Chamberlain Civic Center is fiction.</p> 
   <p>There is very little to say otherwise other than that I did end up using material from all the chapters so far in my final design. I found a suitable image for a splash home page, and I wanted to overlay text on it at the bottom. I wound up using something I had nearly forgotten: the quirks of absolute and relative positioning. I positioned one block element relative and then positioned its contents absolutely inside it. You will see this in my CSS rules. I also carefully engineered the CSS to get the columns in the two-column layout to line up evenly. This was tested in both Firefox and Chrome.</p>
