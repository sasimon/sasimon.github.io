   <li> <h1>Trade Name</h1> <p>Vancomycin hydrochloride</p> </li> 
   <li> <h1>Brand Name</h1> <p>Vancocin</p> </li> 
   <li> <h1>Target Populations</h1> <p>Null</p> </li> 
   <li> <h1>Dosage Form Name</h1> <p>Capsule</p> </li>
   <li> <h1>Route Name</h1> <p>Oral</p> </li> 
   <li> <h1>Indication and Usage</h1>  
   <p>VANCOCIN CAPSULES are indicated for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. VANCOCIN CAPSULES are also used for the treatment of enterocolitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains). Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for the above infections; therefore, VANCOCIN CAPSULES must be given orally for these infections.</p> 
   <p>Orally administered VANCOCIN is not effective for other types of infections.</p> 
   <p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VANCOCIN CAPSULES and other antibacterial drugs, VANCOCIN CAPSULES should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p> </li>  
   <li> <h1>Dose and Administration</h1>  <p>VANCOCIN CAPSULES are used in treating C. difficile-associated diarrhea and staphylococcal enterocolitis. C. difficile-associated diarrhea: The recommended dose is 125 mg administered orally 4 times daily for 10 days.</p> <h2>Staphylococcal enterocolitis</h2> <p>Total daily dosage is 500 mg to 2 g administered orally in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days.</p> <h2>Pediatric Patients</h2> <p>The usual daily dosage is 40 mg/kg in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dosage should not exceed 2 g.</p>  </li> 
   <li> <h1>Contraindications</h1> <p>VANCOCIN CAPSULES are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin.</p></li>
   <li> <h1>Warnings and Precautions</h1>  <h2>Oral Use Only</h2> <p>This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. VANCOCIN CAPSULES must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered VANCOCIN CAPSULES are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation.</p>  </li> 
   <li> <h1>Adverse Reactions</h1>  <h2>Clinical Trial Experience</h2> <p>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to VANCOCIN in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received VANCOCIN 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male.</p>
